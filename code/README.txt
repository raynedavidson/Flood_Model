This notebook is designed to be run in Google Colab. 
Please run it in the Colab environment associated with your GEE account. 
It is designed for the data to be self contained so long a you can mount your google account
that is associated with your GEE account.

If you cannot mount your Google Drive (thats associated with your GEE account),
you will need to manually download the TIFs that are exported in the
"Greater Kinshasa Area (Overview) Download SAR Flood Extents" section
and load them into the pwd in Colab. a small modification (removing the path extention) will 
also be needed in the plotting codes where the TIFs are read into the notebook.
